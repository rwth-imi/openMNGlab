## This method implements the median RMS as defined in the Turnquist-Namer paper dealing with track correlation for fibre tracking.

# @param sweeps The list of sweeps in the recording that should be analyzed
# @param center_sweep_idx Index of the sweep around which we extract the sweeps according to radius, also called k in the paper
# @param latency_slope Slope along which the RMS is calculated. Also called m in the paper, so we have the actual latency as t + r * m, where t is the latency and -R <= r <= R is the index in the R-environment around k. In s/sweep!
# @param latency Latency behind the eletrical stimulus in each sweep around which we look for the median RMS, called t in the paper. In s!
# @param radius Radius or number of sweeps which we want to consider during search of the median RMS, labelled r in the paper
# @param window_size Size of the window around the (computed) latency which is used to calculate the RMS. Given in s!
# @param sampling_rate Sampling rate of the recording, required for array access
